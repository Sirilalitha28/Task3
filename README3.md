Task3- House Price Prediction - Linear Regression

# Objective:

Understand and apply  single and multiple linear regression using a real-world dataset.
Evaluate model performance using MAE, MSE, and R² score.
Interpret model coefficients and plot the regression results.

# Dataset used:

[House Price Prediction Dataset on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)
File used: 'Housing.csv'

# Tools & Libraries used:

Python
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

# Steps Performed:

1. Imported dataset and handled categorical variables with dummies.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Trained a Linear Regression model.
4. Evaluated performance using:   Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
                                  Mean Squared Error (MSE)
                                  R² Score
5. Visualized the actual vs predicted prices.
6. Extracted and printed feature coefficients.
